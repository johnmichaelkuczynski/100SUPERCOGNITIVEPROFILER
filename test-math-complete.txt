Mathematical Test Document

This document contains various mathematical expressions to test the automatic math formatting pipeline:

1. Basic algebra: x + 2 = 5, solve for x
2. Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
3. Calculus: The derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1 is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5
4. Geometry: Area of circle = π * r^2
5. Statistics: Sample mean x̄ = (Σx_i) / n
6. Physics: E = mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, c is speed of light
7. Complex numbers: z = a + bi, where i = sqrt(-1)
8. Matrix notation: A = [a_11 a_12; a_21 a_22]
9. Summation: Σ_{i=1}^{n} i = n(n+1)/2
10. Integral: ∫₀¹ x² dx = 1/3
