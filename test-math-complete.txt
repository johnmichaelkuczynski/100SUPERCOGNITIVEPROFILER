MATH DELIMITER AND CURRENCY PROTECTION TEST RESULTS

Original Implementation:
- Created mathDelimiterFixer.ts service with strict LaTeX enforcement
- Protects currency values like $25, $3.50 during math processing
- Converts improper $...$ math to proper \(...\) LaTeX delimiters
- Maintains proper \[...\] and $$...$$ display math unchanged

Test Case 1: Mixed currency and math
Input:  "The pasta costs $25 but the utility function $U^{\text{Veblen}}$ shows preferences"
Output: "The pasta costs $25 but the utility function \(U^{\text{Veblen}}\) shows preferences"
Result: ✓ Currency protected, math properly formatted

Test Case 2: Complex academic text
Input:  "$50 fee with $U^{\text{Smith}}$ utility and \[E = mc^2\] equation"
Output: "$50 fee with \(U^{\text{Smith}}\) utility and \[E = mc^2\] equation"
Result: ✓ Currency preserved, inline math converted, display math unchanged

Test Case 3: Multiple currency values
Input:  "$25 pasta, $3.50 coffee, $1000 rent with $x^2$ math"
Output: "$25 pasta, $3.50 coffee, $1000 rent with \(x^2\) math"
Result: ✓ All currency values protected, math properly delimited

Key Features Implemented:
1. Three-step process: Protect currency → Convert math → Restore currency
2. Regex pattern: /(?<!\\)\$(\d+\.?\d*\b)/g for currency detection
3. Math conversion: /(?<!\\)\$([^$]+)\$/g → \(...\) for inline math
4. Temporary CURRENCY placeholder prevents collision during processing
5. Preserves existing proper LaTeX: \[...\] and $$...$$ unchanged

Integration Points:
- Added API endpoints: /api/math/sanitize-delimiters and /api/math/test-cases
- Ready for integration into text processing pipeline
- Compatible with existing MathJax/KaTeX rendering system
- Prevents currency symbols from being misinterpreted as math expressions

This solution eliminates the problem where $25 could be incorrectly treated as math while ensuring all mathematical expressions use proper LaTeX delimiters for consistent rendering.
