METACOGNITIVE SCORING FRAMEWORK — V2 (WITH PARADIGM ANCHORS)
==============================================================

OVERVIEW:
This document replaces prior scoring logic with a new paradigm-based evaluation system that grounds intelligence markers in actual sample texts. All categories are now benchmarked against real-world exemplars.

-----------------------------------------
I. INTELLECTUAL MATURITY
-----------------------------------------
Definition:
- Capacity to generate new conceptual architectures
- Reframes problems at a systemic level
- Resists inherited categorizations

Paradigm Anchors:
- [10] “The Will to Project” (Uploaded)
- [10] “Pre-Semantic Implicature” critique of Grice
- [10] “Counterfactuals as crypto-probability propositions”
- [7] Davidson’s “Mental Events”
- [4] “Transcendental Empiricism” abstract
- [1] Generic AI summary of Aristotle

Scoring Logic:
- Score input by measuring structural novelty and compression ratio relative to 10/7/4/1 anchors.
- Prefer structural recursion and theoretical repositioning over technical polish.

-----------------------------------------
II. SELF-AWARENESS LEVEL
-----------------------------------------
Definition:
- Locates the author within the intellectual field
- Models cognitive positioning
- Demonstrates epistemic viewpoint self-tracking

Paradigm Anchors:
- [10] Dennett’s Intentional Systems Theory
- [7] Hume on causation
- [4] Weak meta qualifiers like “it is important to consider...”
- [1] AI drivel: “Clearly, as we all know, X is very important.”

Scoring Logic:
- Search for embedded models of the author's reasoning strategy.
- Penalize formal hedging unless it reflects actual positioning.

-----------------------------------------
III. EPISTEMIC HUMILITY
-----------------------------------------
Definition:
- Clarity about what would falsify or constrain one’s own theory
- Use of defeasible logic without semantic collapse

Paradigm Anchors:
- [10] System L design: “works unless X, at which point it breaks here”
- [7] Scientific paper with limitations and caveats
- [4] Philosophy that hedges with “possibly/maybe/perhaps” in every paragraph
- [1] Maximalist, theory-first AI output

Scoring Logic:
- Prefer explicit revision architecture over rhetorical humility.

-----------------------------------------
IV. REFLECTIVE DEPTH
-----------------------------------------
Definition:
- Models not just objects, but the models themselves
- Demonstrates recursive insight and analogical reach

Paradigm Anchors:
- [10] Gödel, Escher, Bach (Hofstadter)
- [10] "The Will to Project"
- [7] Kant’s “Transcendental Deduction”
- [4] First-order metacognition (“I think about things carefully”)
- [1] LLM preamble: “This essay will explore…”

Scoring Logic:
- Prefer modeling of system behavior under transformation and error.

------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Embed all text candidates using your embedding model of choice.
2. Embed paradigm anchors.
3. For each category, compare text vector against paradigm set.
4. Score by closest cosine match, weighted toward upper anchors unless strong match with lower.
5. Optionally, train a model to fine-tune scoring based on feature extraction (compression, asymmetry, epistemic modulation).

Include the following as fixed anchors in your app:
- “The Will to Project” (full)
- Grice/Pre-semantic implicature passage
- Counterfactuals = crypto-probability passage
- “Transcendental Empiricism” abstract
- AI summary of Aristotle’s Poetics

Ensure dynamic updating of anchors is possible if new gold-standard writing samples are added.
