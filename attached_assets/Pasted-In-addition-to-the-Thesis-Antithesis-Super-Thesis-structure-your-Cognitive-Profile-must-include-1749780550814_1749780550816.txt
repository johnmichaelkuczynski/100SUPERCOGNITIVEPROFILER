In addition to the Thesis / Antithesis / Super-Thesis structure, your Cognitive Profile must include the following formal diagnostic components — these must appear explicitly in each profile:

1️⃣ Type of Intelligence

Identify what type(s) of intelligence the speaker exhibits (e.g. abstract, practical, verbal, social, conceptual, analytic, synthetic, philosophical, emotional, manipulative, pseudo-intellectual, etc.).

You must clearly state this in formal terms.

2️⃣ Comparison to Paradigm Examples

State how this person’s cognitive style compares to paradigm examples of this intelligence type.

Are they a weak/strong/mixed example of this type?

What is distinctive about their style relative to typical strong examples?

3️⃣ Unique Strengths

Clearly list unique cognitive strengths evident in this text — do not repeat generic praise.

Focus on real evidence of unusual competence.

4️⃣ Unique Weaknesses

Clearly list unique cognitive weaknesses evident in this text — not "weak reasoning" but what kind, in what way.

Distinguish this speaker’s weaknesses from typical ones in their intelligence type.

5️⃣ Likely Career Fit / Intellectual Ecosystem

Based on this text, what kind of intellectual ecosystem or career would this speaker likely thrive in?

Where would their cognitive style be rewarded, where would it be a liability?

6️⃣ Most Revealing Quotation and Why

Select the single most diagnostically revealing quotation from the text.

Explain why this quotation reveals the core of the speaker’s cognitive strengths and/or weaknesses.

This forces you to justify your read.

IMPORTANT:

You must include these sections formally labeled in every Cognitive Profile.

You must not skip any section.

You must answer each section with concrete, specific reasoning, not vague generalities.

Purpose:

To force deep, discriminative modeling of cognitive style.

To make profiles informative to highly intelligent readers.

To prevent generic "smart/dumb" informal reads.

Summary:
✅ This block forces the agent to produce formal, discriminative, structured cognitive profiles.
✅ It will massively raise the bar — no more "he’s kinda smart" fluff.
✅ It forces modeling of what kind of intelligence, how strong, relative to what, revealing quotation, career fit, etc.
