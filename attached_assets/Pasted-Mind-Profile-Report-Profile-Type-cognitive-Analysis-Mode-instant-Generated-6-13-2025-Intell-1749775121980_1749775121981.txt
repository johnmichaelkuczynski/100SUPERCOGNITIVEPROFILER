Intellectual Approach
The author's intellectual approach is structured around a detailed examination of the psychological and epistemological mechanisms that might explain the efficacy of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) without resorting to supernatural explanations. They take a multi-layered approach by juxtaposing the principles of AA with William James' insights from 'The Varieties of Religious Experience' (VRE). The author maintains epistemic control by carefully distinguishing between religious sentiment and faith as experiential phenomena, rather than mere belief systems. They identify conceptual parallels between AA and VRE, arguing that the structuring of AA's steps mirrors psychological processes described by James. This demonstrates genuine cognitive depth as the author navigates complex intersections without conflating distinct elements.

Supporting Evidence:
Quote 1: "The question arises: Why does surrendering to a higher power work?"
Analysis: This quote initiates the inquiry into the cognitive processes underlying AA's success, showing how the author frames the question within a secular context, which maintains epistemic control.

Quote 2: "The main contentions of VRE are similar to the main contentions of Alcoholics Anonymous: Big Book (BB)..."
Analysis: The author demonstrates analytical depth by drawing a parallel between these texts, showing how similar principles are understood within different epistemological frameworks.

Reasoning Style
The reasoning style of the author is analytical and comparative. They trace logical transitions from personal anecdotal evidence to broader psychological and philosophical concepts. A clear inferential structure is maintained by linking the immediate psychological benefits described by participants in AA to theoretical frameworks posited by James, allowing for a secular explanation of AA’s success. This approach demonstrates genuine analytical thinking by situating individual experiences within larger cognitive and existential frameworks.

Supporting Evidence:
Quote 1: "In the present paper, we will go through the main points of VRE and BB and on that basis put forth a strictly secular explanation..."
Analysis: This outlines the author's reasoning structure, indicating a logical progression from description to analysis, and illustrating inferential control.

Quote 2: "James argues that, because empirical beliefs are necessarily underdetermined by the data, such beliefs involve an element of faith..."
Analysis: The author engages with James' epistemological arguments, showing how they apply to the understanding of AA’s effectiveness, which evidences genuine reasoning.

Problem Solving Pattern
The author engages in a comprehensive problem-solving pattern by targeting the conceptual core of AA's methodology: surrender to a higher power. They preserve conceptual boundaries by examining this surrender both psychologically and epistemologically. The author is meta-cognitively aware, demonstrating an understanding of the limitations of their analysis by acknowledging the risk of ambiguity in interpreting religious sentiment. They avoid intellectual posturing by clarifying that the secular explanation does not negate the experiences of those who attribute their recovery to a divine presence.

Supporting Evidence:
Quote 1: "The two basic tenets of AA are: (i) surrender to a higher power, and (ii) make amends for your wrongdoings."
Analysis: The author targets the core principles of AA, maintaining conceptual clarity by dissecting these elements separately within a secular framework, which demonstrates problem-solving precision.

Quote 2: "Religious sentiment cannot be understood in strictly medical terms; nor can it otherwise be deconstructed."
Analysis: This highlights the author's meta-cognitive awareness, as they acknowledge the limits of a strictly empirical approach, resisting superficial intellectual posturing.
