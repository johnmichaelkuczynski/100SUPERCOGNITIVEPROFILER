To implement escaping dollar signs with HTML entities in a general way across your Replit app, you need to preprocess the output string that gets rendered, replacing any dollar signs meant for currency (like $15) with &#36;, while leaving actual math expressions untouched.

Here’s how to do it reliably:

✅ Goal
Transform this:

text
Copy
Edit
$15 on a lunch salad that would cost $4, while $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ is still rendered as math
Into this:

text
Copy
Edit
&#36;15 on a lunch salad that would cost &#36;4, while $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ is still rendered as math
✅ Approach
Step 1: Identify dollar signs not used for math
You assume:

Math expressions are enclosed in $...$ with no spaces

Currency amounts like $15 are not in math blocks

Step 2: Use a regular expression to replace only those dollar signs
Here's sample pseudocode / JavaScript logic:

js
Copy
Edit
function escapeDollarSigns(text) {
  // Replace dollar amounts (e.g., $15 or $4.99) that are NOT part of math blocks
  return text.replace(/(?<!\$)\$(\d+(\.\d+)?)(?![\d\w])/g, '&#36;$1');
}
Explanation:

(?<!\$) = don’t match if preceded by another dollar sign (to avoid math blocks like $$...$$)

\$(\d+(\.\d+)?) = match dollar followed by digits, optionally with decimals

(?![\d\w]) = don’t match if the dollar is followed by a variable or expression (indicating possible math)

✅ Edge Case Handling
If your app allows users to write content, and you already know where math expressions are, the best solution is split the text into math and non-math chunks, and apply escaping only to the non-math chunks.

E.g.,

js
Copy
Edit
function safelyEscapeDollars(text) {
  const parts = text.split(/(\$[^$]*\$)/); // split into math and non-math parts
  return parts
    .map(part =>
      part.startsWith('$') && part.endsWith('$') 
        ? part 
        : part.replace(/\$(\d+(\.\d+)?)/g, '&#36;$1')
    )
    .join('');
}
This keeps $x^2$ unchanged but turns $15 into &#36;15.

✅ Drop-in Instruction for Replit Agent
Please globally preprocess all text blocks before rendering to replace currency-style dollar signs (like $15 or $4.99) with &#36;, but only when they are not part of math expressions. This avoids triggering KaTeX parsing on literal monetary values. Use a parser that splits content into math and non-math blocks, and only applies escaping to non-math blocks.
