**Project Brief: Core Functionality and Total System Specification**

---

**1. Core Idea:**
This app is a high-context, no-throttle writing, reasoning, and analysis engine for thinkers, writers, and serious users. It acts as a seamless passthrough interface for multiple large language models (LLMs) — Claude, GPT-4, and Perplexity — with advanced support for document uploads, large-scale text generation, and user self-analysis.

**2. Primary Capabilities:**

* **LLM Passthrough:**

  * Routes prompts and documents to Claude, GPT-4, and Perplexity
  * User selects model per interaction or sets a default
  * Maintains full prompt/response transparency (no hidden formatting)

* **File Upload and Processing:**

  * Accepts text files, Word docs, PDFs, and images
  * Text extracted from PDFs and DOCX files
  * OCR applied to images for text extraction

* **Large Text Processing (up to 500,000 words):**

  * Automatically chunks documents
  * Preserves context across chunks
  * Handles summarization, rewriting, extraction, and analysis across full-scale books

* **Large-Scale Text Generation:**

  * Supports user requests for generation of long documents (e.g. 500,000 words)
  * Breaks down generation requests into coordinated sequences with consistent tone, structure, and logic

* **Output Handling:**

  * Outputs can be streamed or returned in full
  * Results downloadable as plain text, PDF, or DOCX

**3. Psychoanalytic + Self-Analysis Module:**

This app includes an optional, opt-in system for building self-profiles and longitudinal intelligence analysis.

* **User Profiles:**

  * Profiles are tied to user email
  * Profiles persist across sessions

* **Data Logging:**

  * Logs interactions per user (prompt, model, timestamp, output)
  * Extracts metadata on style, tone, topic, conceptual density, sentiment

* **Synchronic Reports:**

  * Snapshot analysis of user’s intellectual, emotional, and stylistic state
  * Available in short, medium, or long formats
  * Includes narrative description, analytics, charts, and visual summaries

* **Diachronic Reports:**

  * Analyzes trends over user-specified period (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months)
  * Detects changes in language, attention, conceptual focus, mood, abstraction, and more

* **Custom Reports:**

  * Users can request focus on specific areas (e.g., emotional stability, argumentative clarity, topic obsession)

**4. Architecture and Technical Notes:**

* Backend supports chunked long-context handling for Claude and GPT-4
* File processing layer handles DOCX → text, PDF → text, image → OCR
* Modular routing system supports model-specific behavior and token constraints
* Longform session memory optionally persists between days
* Charts and analytics generated using open-source or embedded JS libraries

---

**5. Legal and Branding:**

* Claude, GPT, and Perplexity are not used in name or title of the app
* Descriptions may state: “Powered by advanced language models”
* No claim of proprietary LLM tech
* System is API-compliant with all integrated providers

**6. Use Cases and Audience:**
This is not a novelty app or corporate productivity toy. It is for anyone — intellectuals, writers, developers, therapists, coaches, independent professionals — who want serious, high-resolution insight into their thinking, language, and self-development over time.

**7. Closing Statement:**
This app is the execution layer for serious thought. It eliminates artificial constraints, supports extreme-scale generation and interpretation, and reflects the user back to himself with forensic precision. It doesn’t pretend to be a mind. It holds up a mirror to yours.
