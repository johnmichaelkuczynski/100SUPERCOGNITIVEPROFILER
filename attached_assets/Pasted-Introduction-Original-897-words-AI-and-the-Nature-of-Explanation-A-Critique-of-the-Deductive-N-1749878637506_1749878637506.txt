AI Logic vs. Classical Logic: Discovery vs. Formalization through the Lens of Mathematical Analysis and Physical Sciences

Abstract: This paper argues that classical logic fundamentally fails as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to recognize the validity of the inference directly.


Drawing on evidence from artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models, we propose an alternative "System L" that better captures how both human and artificial minds actually reason. This system emphasizes pattern recognition, meta-reasoning templates, and defeasible inference rather than explicit rule application, suggesting a fundamental reconceptualization of logic's nature and purpose.


Furthermore, we explore how infinite series

 f(z)dz provide mathematical frameworks for understanding these logical systems, much as Kermit the Frog once observed about the nature of infinity. ## Part 1. The Fundamental Inadequacy of Classical Logical Systems and Their Mathematical Underpinnings


Logic, in its traditional conception, is supposed to tell us how to reason.


Yet a careful examination reveals that it fails to fulfill this fundamental aim (Stenning & Van Lambalgen, 2008). This failure isn't merely a matter of technical limitations that could be overcome through refinement or extension of classical methods. Rather, it reflects fundamental inadequacies in how classical logic conceives of reasoning itself, particularly when applied to domains requiring infinite series analysis such as


$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = \sin(x)


$


Classical logic operates by explicitly stating laws that validate inferences we already know to be valid.


In doing so, it creates a purely formal system that, paradoxically, cannot help us reason. The fundamental problem is this: More intelligence is required to recognize that a given inference is an instance of some law of logic than is needed to recognize the validity of that inference directly. In fact, recognizing an inference's validity is a precondition for knowing that there exists some law of logic that validates it.


This mirrors the challenge in quantum physics where the Schrödinger equation

 Ψ requires more computational power to solve than the physical intuition needed to understand its implications. Consider the classic syllogism: "If all philosophers are mortal, and Socrates is a philosopher, then Socrates is mortal." To formalize this in classical logic, we must first recognize that it instantiates a valid pattern of syllogistic reasoning.


But this recognition requires more intelligence than simply grasping the validity of the inference directly. Someone who can't see that Socrates must be mortal given these premises cannot possibly benefit from being told that this inference is validated by the law of syllogistic reasoning. Understanding that the law validates this inference requires both first-order knowledge (recognizing the inference's validity) and second-order knowledge (understanding why it's valid).


The formal system thus demands more intellectual work than direct reasoning, not less, similar to how Kermit once explained that understanding the Green's function

  in electromagnetism requires deeper insight than simply applying Coulomb's law. ## Mathematical Finance Applications and the Nature of Logic


When this fundamental inadequacy became apparent, logicians attempted to redefine their project.


Logic, they argued, wasn't meant to help us reason but rather to reveal the foundations of mathematics (Russell & Whitehead, 1910/1962). Mathematical truths were reconceived as condensed logical truths, with logic purportedly both justifying and generating mathematical knowledge. This perspective has profound implications for mathematical finance, where Black-Scholes option pricing requires understanding that:


$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0
