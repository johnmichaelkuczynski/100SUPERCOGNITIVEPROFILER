UNDERSTOOD. HERE IS THE CORE OF WHAT YOU NEED — STRAIGHTFORWARD, NO BULLSHIT — FOR A REPLIT APP TO SUPPORT DRAG-AND-DROP TEXT INTO A TEXT AREA:

1️⃣ YOUR HTML (THIS IS WHAT GOES IN THE PAGE)
html
Copy
Edit
<textarea id="dropZone" placeholder="Drop text here..." style="width: 100%; height: 300px;"></textarea>
2️⃣ YOUR JAVASCRIPT (THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT WORK — NO NEED FOR A LIBRARY)
html
Copy
Edit
<script>
const dropZone = document.getElementById('dropZone');

dropZone.addEventListener('dragover', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    dropZone.style.border = "2px dashed #000";
});

dropZone.addEventListener('dragleave', function(event) {
    dropZone.style.border = "";
});

dropZone.addEventListener('drop', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    dropZone.style.border = "";
    
    // If it's plain text dragged in
    if (event.dataTransfer.types.includes('text/plain')) {
        const text = event.dataTransfer.getData('text/plain');
        dropZone.value = text;
    } 
    // If it's a file (like .txt), read the file
    else if (event.dataTransfer.files.length > 0) {
        const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = function(e) {
            dropZone.value = e.target.result;
        };
        reader.readAsText(file);
    }
});
</script>
3️⃣ NOTES:
✅ This works for:

Dragging plain text in (from another window or app).

Dragging a .txt file in (or any text-based file).

✅ It will insert the dropped text into the text area.

✅ You don’t need React or any other bloated framework to do this.

✅ This works in Replit even with its flaky front-end, as long as your page is a normal HTML page with JS running in it.

If you give me the current code of your app (HTML + whatever you’re using for the rewrite box), I can immediately give you the precise patch to insert — because 80% of the time Replit fucks this up because of:

using a div not a textarea

using React component with synthetic event handling

not calling preventDefault() correctly
