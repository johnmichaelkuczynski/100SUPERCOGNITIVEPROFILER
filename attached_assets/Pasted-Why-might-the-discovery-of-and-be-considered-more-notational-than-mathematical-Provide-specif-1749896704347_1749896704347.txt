Why might the discovery of ℤ and ℚ be considered "more notational than mathematical"? Provide specific examples to support your answer. For each of the following number systems, identify the precise nature of its elements: a) ℕ b) ℤ c) ℚ d) Signed rationals

ANSWERS: The statement "-(\frac{2}{5}) is less than +(\frac{1}{3})" can be expressed in terms of cardinal relationships as follows: For any cardinal numbers a, b, c, and d where a bears the relation \frac{2}{5} to b (i.e., a × 5 = b × 2) and c bears the relation \frac{1}{3} to d (i.e., c × 3 = d × 1), if we consider the negative of the first relation and the positive of the second relation, then the former is less than the latter.

This ultimately reduces to comparing -\frac{2}{5} and +\frac{1}{3}, which can be verified by converting to a common denominator: -\frac{6}{15} and +\frac{5}{15}, showing that -\frac{2}{5} . ℤ can be considered "contained in" ℕ in the sense that every statement about integers can be reformulated as a statement about natural numbers. For example, the integer equation a + b = c can be reformulated using natural numbers as (a^+ - a^-) + (b^+ - b^-) = (c^+ - c^-), where a^+, a^-, b^+, b^-, c^+, and c^- are all natural numbers.

This reformulation demonstrates that integers don't allow us to express anything that couldn't already be expressed using natural numbers, albeit less efficiently. The discovery of ℤ and ℚ can be considered "more notational than mathematical" because: They don't allow us to express mathematical truths that couldn't already be expressed using ℕ. The primary advantage they provide is notational efficiency rather than new mathematical content.

For example, the equation x + 3 = 2 in ℤ has the solution x = -1, but this could be expressed in ℕ as "the number which, when added to 3, gives 2" or more formally as a pair of natural numbers (a,b) where a + 3 = b + 2. Similarly, \frac{2}{3} in ℚ could be expressed in ℕ as the relationship between two natural numbers m and n where 2n = 3m. a) ℕ$: Elements are class-sizes (cardinal numbers) representing the sizes of finite collections

The Real Number System: Logical and Set-Theoretic Foundations Recursion and the Structure of Number Systems 1 Recursive Definition of Classes

A class K is defined recursively when its membership is characterized by two conditions: (1) a base case that identifies certain fundamental elements as belonging to K, and (2) an inductive case that specifies how to generate new members of K from existing ones.

Formally, for some α ∈ K and some ordering relation R, x ∈ K if and only if:

(a) x = α, or (b) β bears R to x, where β ∈ K. This recursive approach proves essential in constructing the foundations of the real number system, as it allows us to build complex structures from simpler ones in a systematic manner. The connection to the real number system becomes apparent when we consider that all standard number systems—natural numbers, integers, rationals, and ultimately the reals—can be constructed using recursive definitions as their foundation.

Hints for Exercises: When working with recursive definitions, always identify (1) the base case(s) and (2) the recursive step(s). Then verify that every claimed member of the class can be derived from the base case through repeated application of the recursive step. Exercises: Consider the class E defined recursively as follows: 3 ∈ E, and if x ∈ E, then x + 5 ∈ E.

List the first six elements of E. Prove that every element in the class E from Exercise 1 can be expressed in the form 3 + 5n for some n ∈ ℕ. Define a class P recursively where π ∈ P and if x ∈ P, then x² ∈ P.

Show that this class has important connections to transcendental numbers. Consider how we might recursively define the set of all numbers that can be expressed as m/2ⁿ where m, n ∈ ℕ. Give the recursive definition and explain how this relates to the dyadic rationals.

Let S be defined recursively as follows: 1 ∈ S, and if x ∈ S, then both x + √2 and x · √2 are in S. Prove that S contains only irrational numbers except for the base case. Answers: E = {3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, ...} Base case: 3 = 3 + 5·0, so it has the form 3 + 5n.

Inductive step: Assume x = 3 + 5k for some k ∈ ℕ. Then x + 5 = (3 + 5k) + 5 = 3 + 5(k+1), which has the required form. By the principle of mathematical induction, every element in E has the form 3 + 5n.

P = {π, π², π⁴, π⁸, ...}.

Since π is transcendental, all powers of π are also transcendental, making P a subset of the transcendental numbers (except possibly for powers that equal rational numbers, which can be proven impossible). Let D be the set of dyadic rationals. Recursive definition: 0 ∈ D; if x ∈ D, then x + 1 ∈ D and x/2 ∈ D.

This generates all numbers of form m/2ⁿ. For any x ∈ S where x ≠ 1, x is irrational. Proof: The only rational in the base case is 1.

For the inductive step, if x is rational and x ≠ 1, then x + √2 and x · √2 are both irrational (by the closure properties of rational numbers and the irrationality of √2). 4.2 Recursivity and the Natural Numbers

The natural numbers (ℕ) provide the most fundamental example of a recursively defined class in mathematics.

Their membership is given by the following recursion:

x ∈ ℕ if and only if either: (i) x = 0, or (ii) x = y + 1, where y ∈ ℕ. Stated in formal logical notation: ∀x(x ∈ ℕ ↔ (x = 0 ∨ ∃y(y ∈ ℕ ∧ x = y + 1)))

This definition embodies the essence of the Peano axioms, which form the axiomatic foundation of the natural numbers. The recursive nature of this definition allows us to systematically generate the entire infinite sequence of natural numbers from a single starting point.

In general, a recursive definition of a class κ takes the form: ∀x(x ∈ κ ↔ (x = α ∨ ∃β(β ∈ κ ∧ βℛx))),

where: (i) ℛ is a relation that strictly orders κ, and (ii) α is the ℛ-smallest element of κ, meaning that there is something to which α bears ℛ but nothing that bears ℛ to α. The natural numbers serve as the foundation upon which we build the entire real number system. Understanding their recursive structure is essential for comprehending how more complex number systems are constructed.

Hints for Exercises: When working with recursive definitions of number systems, focus on how each new system extends the previous one while preserving its essential properties. Pay attention to how the ordering relation changes as we move from one system to another. Exercises: Using the recursive definition of ℕ, prove that 3 ∈ ℕ by showing the sequence of steps that generates 3 from the base element 0.

Let S(n) represent the successor function defined as S(n) = n + 1. Express the recursive definition of ℕ using the successor function instead of addition. Define the set of even natural numbers recursively.

Then define the set of odd natural numbers recursively. Prove that the sum of any two natural numbers can be computed using only the successor function and recursion. Consider how we might extend the recursive definition of ℕ to define the integers (ℤ).

Provide a recursive definition for ℤ that builds upon the definition of ℕ. The well-ordering principle states that every non-empty subset of ℕ has a least element. Explain how this principle relates to the recursive definition of ℕ.

Answers: Starting with 0 ∈ ℕ (base case): 1 = 0 + 1, so 1 ∈ ℕ (by the recursive step) 2 = 1 + 1, so 2 ∈ ℕ (by the recursive step) 3 = 2 + 1, so 3 ∈ ℕ (by the recursive step) x ∈ ℕ if and only if either: (i) x = 0, or (ii) x = S(y), where y ∈ ℕ. Formally: ∀x(x ∈ ℕ ↔ (x = 0 ∨ ∃y(y ∈ ℕ ∧ x = S(y)))) Even natural numbers (E): 0 ∈ E If n ∈ E, then n + 2 ∈ E

Odd natural numbers (O): 1 ∈ O If n ∈ O, then n + 2 ∈ O Define addition recursively: n + 0 = n (base case) n + S(m) = S(n + m) (recursive step) Using these rules, we can compute any sum using only the successor function and recursion.

Recursive definition of ℤ: 0 ∈ ℤ (base case) If n ∈ ℤ, then S(n) ∈ ℤ (positive direction) If n ∈ ℤ, then P(n) ∈ ℤ (negative direction) Where P(n) is the predecessor function defined as P(n) = n - 1. The well-ordering principle is intimately connected to the recursive definition of ℕ because the recursive structure ensures that every natural number can be reached by starting at 0 and repeatedly applying the successor function.

This creates a strict ordering where every non-empty subset must have a least element, as there is no infinite descending chain in ℕ. 4.3 Sequences as Discrete Series

A sequence is a discrete series—a structure where every non-terminal member has an immediate successor.

The natural numbers under their standard ordering, (ℕ, <), provide the prototypical example of a discrete series. Formally, a discrete series can be viewed as a recursively defined class of ordered pairs (x, x), where x is a cardinal number representing position in the sequence, and x is a member of some class K representing the value at that position. For example, consider the sequence S₀: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

In S₀, 0 occupies the first position, 1 the second, 2 the third, and so on. This sequence can be represented as the class of ordered pairs: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), ...

Similarly, if Sis the sequence of perfect squares: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...

Then Scorresponds to the class of ordered pairs: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), ...

S₀ and Smay be identified with classes K₀ and K, where:

K₀ = {(x, y): ∀x(x ∈ ℕ ∧ y = x)}

K= {(x, y): ∀x(x ∈ ℕ ∧ y = x²)}

These classes K₀ and Kare unordered collections of ordered pairs. More generally, any series σ may be identified with an unordered class κ of pairs (x, y), where x ∈ ℕ and y ∈ κ, provided that the appropriate succession relationship holds. The sequences S₀ and Sare generated by functions φ₀ and φ, where:

φ₀(0) = 0; φ₀(n+1) = φ₀(n) + 1

and

φ(0) = 0; φ(n+1) = (n+1)²

Each of these functions is a recursive function—its values are defined in terms of previously computed values.

This is a crucial insight: all sequences can be generated by recursive functions, and all recursive functions generate sequences. This connection between sequences and recursive functions is fundamental to understanding the structure of the real number system, particularly when we consider how to enumerate the rational numbers and how to prove that the real numbers cannot be enumerated. Hints for Exercises: When working with sequences as discrete series, focus on (1) the function that generates the sequence, (2) the ordering relation that structures the sequence, and (3) the relationship between position and value in the sequence.

Exercises: Consider the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

Express this as a recursive function and identify the first five ordered pairs in the corresponding discrete series. Define the sequence of triangular numbers recursively. Then express it as a closed-form formula in terms of position.

Prove that every arithmetic sequence can be generated by a recursive function of the form φ(0) = a, φ(n+1) = φ(n) + d for constants a and d. Consider the sequence defined by a₁ = 1, aₙ₊₁ = 2aₙ + 1. Express the first six terms of this sequence and prove that every term can be written as 2ⁿ - 1.

The sequence of rational numbers can be arranged in various ways. Describe a recursive procedure that generates a sequence containing every positive rational number exactly once. Consider how we might represent the sequence of all real algebraic numbers (roots of non-zero polynomials with integer coefficients).

Explain why this sequence can be arranged in a discrete series despite the fact that the real numbers as a whole cannot. Answers: Fibonacci sequence recursive function: F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n) for n ≥ 0

First five ordered pairs: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3) Triangular numbers T(n): T(0) = 0 T(n+1) = T(n) + (n+1) for n ≥ 0

Closed form: T(n) = n(n+1)/2 Let φ(n) be the nth term of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference d.

Base case: φ(0) = a Recursive step: φ(n+1) = φ(n) + d

This generates the sequence a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ..., which is precisely the definition of an arithmetic sequence.

First six terms: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63

Proof by induction: Base case: a₁ = 1 = 2¹ - 1 Inductive step: Assume aₖ = 2ᵏ - 1 Then aₖ₊₁ = 2aₖ + 1 = 2(2ᵏ - 1) + 1 = 2ᵏ⁺¹ - 2 + 1 = 2ᵏ⁺¹ - 1 Therefore, aₙ = 2ⁿ - 1 for all n ≥ 1. Calkin-Wilf sequence: Start with 1/1 For each fraction a/b in the sequence, the next two fractions are a/(a+b) and (a+b)/b

This generates: 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 1/3, 3/2, 2/3, 3/1, ...

It can be proven that this sequence contains every positive rational number exactly once. The real algebraic numbers can be enumerated by: Arranging polynomials with integer coefficients by their "complexity" (e.g., sum of absolute values of coefficients plus degree) For each polynomial, listing its real roots in ascending order

This creates a discrete series because: There are countably many polynomials with integer coefficients Each polynomial has finitely many real roots We can establish a bijection between ℕ and this sequence

Unlike the set of all real numbers, the algebraic numbers form a countable set, which allows them to be arranged in a discrete series. 4.4 Recursivity and Computability

The concept of recursivity is deeply connected to computability—the ability to systematically calculate values through a well-defined procedure.

According to the conventional wisdom in computability theory, a problem is computable precisely when its solution is the output of a recursive function. While this characterization captures the essence of computability, it requires some qualification. Technically, the solution to any given problem can be considered the solution to some recursive function.

If A is the answer to any question Q, it is always possible to define some recursively defined class K to which A belongs. Therefore, when we say that an answer A can be computed, what we mean more precisely is that, for some class K:

(i) K is recursively defined, (ii) A belongs to K* (

Diagonalization and the Uncountability of the Real Numbers

Since, for any sequence L, D(L) is a real number, there is no sequence containing every member of ℝ. This remarkable fact leads to a profound conclusion: there is no enumerative definition of ℝ. Consequently, there is no recursive definition of the real number system.

This represents one of the fundamental distinctions between the real numbers and other number systems like the natural numbers or rational numbers. To understand this more deeply, recall that when we construct D(L) from a sequence L of real numbers, we deliberately create a real number that differs from every entry in the sequence. Since D
