Logic and Set Theory as the Basis of the Real Number System

The foundational principles of logic and set theory provide the structural framework for understanding the real number system. Each principle will be used to delineate key aspects of the real number system, with illustrative examples and theorems that demonstrate their significance. Following each analysis, answers to \emph{self-reflective explanations} will reinforce comprehension and practical application: Propositional Calculus: Definitions and Theorems

The propositional calculus forms the basis for logical reasoning about mathematical statements.

The following definitions and theorems are oriented for constructing proofs and understanding the properties of real numbers.

**Logical Connectives**

Let \(P\) and \(Q\) (averages represents the value of a proposition). * Conjunction: \(P \land Q\) (\(\land P\land Q\) represents the truth value of a proposition). * Implication: \(P \to Q\) (interpreted as "if \(P\) then \(Q\)"). **Disjunction: \(P \lor Q\) (\(P\lor Q\) interpreted as \(P\) OR \(Q\)) and of two propositions.** Negation: \(\neg P\) (\(\neg P\) asserts the truth value of a proposition). **Implication: \(P \to Q\) (interpreted as if \(P\) then \(Q\))**

**De Morgan's Laws**: \(\neg(P \lor Q) \leftrightarrow (\neg P \land \neg Q)\) and \(\neg(P \land Q) \leftrightarrow (\neg P \lor \neg Q)\) are foundational for set complements. **Modus Ponens**: \((P \to Q) \land P \vdash Q\) is equivalent to inference rule. **Modus Tollens**: \((P \to Q) \land \neg Q \vdash \neg P\) is equivalent to inference rule.

**Functions and Injections are central to defining the real numbers as a complete ordered field.**

**Functions:**

A function \(f: (ghi)\) assigns a unique output \(y\) to each input \(x\).

**A function ensures a one-to-one correspondence between sets, critical for defining cardinality. 2. Cartesian Products.**

The Cartesian product \(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = \{(a, b) : a \in A, b \in B\}\) constructs ordered pairs, foundational for relations and functions. **3. Induction and Power Sets.**

**Proof by induction** shows that the power set of a set with \(n\) elements has \(2^n\) subsets.

This principle underpins the construction of infinite sets like the real numbers. **Modality and Necessity in Mathematics**

**Modal logic extends to mathematical necessity and possibility.**

**Necessity**: \(\square P\) means \(P\) is true in all possible cases, such as the universality of \(1 + 2 = 3\). **2. Possibility**: \(\lozenge P\) means \(P\) is true in at least one case, such as the existence of a solution to an equation. **Exercises and Answer Key**

For example, if \(k = n\), then \(P_k = 2^n\). **Advanced Set Theory and Functions**

**Functions and bijections are central to defining the real numbers as a complete ordered field.**

**Functions:**

A function \(f: ghi\) assigns a unique output \(y\) to each input \(x\).

**A function ensures a one-to-one correspondence between sets, critical for defining cardinality. 2. Cartesian Products.**

The Cartesian product \(\alpha\) equals beta across gamma \(\gamma \in \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\}\) constructs ordered pairs, foundational for relations and functions. **3. Induction and Power Sets.**

This principle underpins the construction of infinite sets like the real numbers. **Modality and Necessity in Mathematics**

**Modal logic extends to mathematical necessity and possibility.**

**Necessity**: \(\forall P\) means \(P\) is true in all possible cases, such as the universality of \(1 + 2 = 3\). **2. Possibility**: \(\exists P\) means \(P\) is true in at least one case, such as the existence of a solution to an equation.

**Distributive Laws**: \(P \land (Q \lor R) \equiv (P \land Q) \lor (P \land R)\)

**Absorption Laws**: \(P \lor (P \land Q) \equiv P\) and \(P \land (P \lor Q) \equiv P\)

**Proof by induction** shows that the power set of a set with \(n\) elements has \(2^n\) subsets.

**The power set \(\mathcal{P}(X)\) of a set \(X\) has cardinality \(2^{|X|}\), proven by induction.**

For example, if \(k = n\), then \(\mathcal{P}_k = 2^n\). **Advanced Set Theory and Functions**

**Functions and bijections are central to defining the real numbers as a complete ordered field.**

**Functions:**

A function \(f: A \to B\) assigns a unique output \(y \in B\) to each input \(x \in A\).

**Injective**: \(\forall x_1, x_2 \in A, f(x_1) = f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2\)

**Surjective**: \(\forall y \in B, \exists x \in A, f(x) = y\)

**Bijective**: Both injective and surjective

**Set Operations and Relations**

**Union**: \(A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \lor x \in B\}\)

**Intersection**: \(A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \land x \in B\}\)

**Complement**: \(A^c = \{x \in U : x \notin A\}\) where \(U\) is the universal set

**Difference**: \(A \setminus B = \{x : x \in A \land x \notin B\}\)

**Number Systems and Cardinality**

**Natural Numbers**: \(\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}\) with cardinality \(\aleph_0\)

**Integers**: \(\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}\) with cardinality \(\aleph_0\)

**Rationals**: \(\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{p}{q} : p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0\}\) with cardinality \(\aleph_0\)

**Reals**: \(\mathbb{R}\) with cardinality \(2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c}\) (continuum)

**Complex Numbers**: \(\mathbb{C} = \{a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i^2 = -1\}\)

**Completeness and Ordering**

The real numbers form a complete ordered field, meaning:

1. **Field Axioms**: Closure, associativity, commutativity, identity, and inverse properties for addition and multiplication

2. **Order Axioms**: Trichotomy, transitivity, and compatibility with field operations

3. **Completeness Axiom**: Every non-empty set bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum)

Formally: \(\forall S \subseteq \mathbb{R}, S \neq \emptyset \land (\exists M \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in S, x \leq M) \Rightarrow \exists \sup S \in \mathbb{R}\)

**Limit and Continuity Concepts**

**Limit**: \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L\) means \(\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall x, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon\)

**Continuity**: \(f\) is continuous at \(a\) if \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)\)

**Uniform Continuity**: \(\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall x, y \in \text{domain}, |x - y| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon\)

**Currency and Economics (Non-Mathematical)**

The cost analysis shows expenses of $25 for materials, $1,000 for equipment, and $500 for labor, totaling $1,525 for the project budget.

**Topology**: Open sets, closed sets, compactness, and connectedness in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)

**Measure Theory**: Lebesgue measure \(\mu\) and integration \(\int_E f \, d\mu\)

**Real Analysis**: Sequences \(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\), series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\), and convergence tests

**Abstract Algebra**: Groups \((G, \cdot)\), rings \((R, +, \cdot)\), and fields \((F, +, \cdot)\)
