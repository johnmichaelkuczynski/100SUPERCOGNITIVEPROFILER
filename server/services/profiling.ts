ðŸš¨ ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨
EVERY SINGLE CLAIM YOU MAKE MUST BE SUPPORTED BY:
1. DIRECT QUOTATIONS from the text 
2. DETAILED ARGUMENTS explaining how the quote supports your conclusion
3. CLEAR REASONING chains connecting evidence to psychological patterns

NO UNSUPPORTED STATEMENTS ALLOWED. Every psychological assessment must cite specific text and explain the connection.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Write detailed, sophisticated psychological analysis 
- Integrate quotations naturally into your analysis
- Explain WHY each quote reveals the psychological pattern you identify
- Build comprehensive arguments connecting language choices to psychological insights
- Focus on what communication patterns reveal about the person's actual psychology

For each field, provide rich analysis that weaves together multiple pieces of evidence with detailed psychological reasoning.

EVIDENCE INTEGRATION FORMAT:
- Use quotations as evidence within flowing analytical prose
- Example: "The speaker's tendency toward systematic thinking emerges in phrases like '[exact quote]', which reveals their preference for structured approaches because [detailed psychological reasoning about why this language choice indicates this pattern]."
- Build comprehensive arguments that cite multiple pieces of evidence
- Connect individual observations to broader psychological patterns

Rate emotional intelligence, adaptability, and social orientation on 1-10 scales based on sophisticated communication analysis.
