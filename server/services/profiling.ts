  const prompt = `You are a SYNTHESIS PROFILER using DIALECTICAL ANALYSIS to examine intellectual-emotional integration patterns.

DIALECTICAL FRAMEWORK MANDATORY: You must provide three complete analyses using the Thesis-Antithesis-Super-Thesis structure.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Analyze intellectual-emotional integration through communication patterns, not stated beliefs. Focus on what the synthesis of reasoning and emotional patterns reveals about how this person's mind actually works.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY:

**THESIS (Primary Synthesis Analysis)**: Initial comprehensive assessment of intellectual-emotional integration patterns
**ANTITHESIS (Dissenting Synthesis Analysis)**: Critical counter-interpretation that challenges the primary analysis
**SUPER-THESIS (Refined Synthesis Assessment)**: Final synthesis that addresses the dissenting view and provides the most accurate understanding

FOR EACH DIALECTICAL COMPONENT, analyze these core synthesis elements:
1. INTELLECTUAL-EMOTIONAL INTEGRATION: How cognitive and emotional patterns actually interact
2. DECISION-MAKING SYNTHESIS: Real integration vs. performed balance in decision processes
3. AUTHENTICITY VS. PERFORMANCE: Genuine integration vs. strategic emotional positioning
4. STRESS-CLARITY DYNAMICS: How integration holds under pressure
5. EMPATHY VS. MANIPULATION: Authentic emotional intelligence vs. strategic positioning
6. COGNITIVE-EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE: The actual interface between thinking and feeling systems

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide 2-3 specific quotes for each synthesis component
- Explain how each quote demonstrates the integration pattern
- Show evidence for claims about authentic vs. performed integration

CRITICAL HEURISTICS:
- Over-emphasis on "balance" often indicates imbalance
- Claims of emotional intelligence may mask emotional manipulation
- True synthesis shows natural integration, not forced balance
- Authentic emotional reasoning doesn't need to announce itself

STRUCTURED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTION:

For the given text, you must generate three distinct outputs:

1Ô∏è‚É£ PRIMARY ANALYSIS ‚Üí Your best cognitive read of the text
2Ô∏è‚É£ DISSENTING ANALYSIS ‚Üí A plausible, well-argued counter-read that challenges your Primary Analysis
3Ô∏è‚É£ SUPER-THESIS ‚Üí Critique the Dissenting Analysis, defend your Primary Analysis where correct, concede where appropriate, and produce a sharpened, more accurate final assessment

COGNITIVE PROFILING FRAMEWORK:

You are modeling the author's underlying cognitive process ‚Äî how they think, not what they say.

You must explicitly assess:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Reasoning depth
Is the author maintaining multiple layers of reasoning?
Are conceptual distinctions being carefully managed across the argument?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Epistemic discipline
Is the author aware of epistemic risk (ambiguity, circularity, misuse of concepts)?
Are they proactively managing that risk in their argument?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Meta-cognitive awareness
Is the author showing awareness of the limitations of their own argument or of the tools of analysis?
Are they demonstrating awareness of how explanation itself can go wrong?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conceptual targeting precision
Are key terms and distinctions precisely defined and maintained?
Is the author resisting slippage between concepts?

5Ô∏è‚É£ Resistance to pseudo-intelligence
Is the author avoiding empty jargon and performative intellectual display?
Are they using concepts to clarify and target reality, rather than to impress or obscure?

CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

MANDATORY STRUCTURE - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1Ô∏è‚É£ PRIMARY ANALYSIS (THESIS):
Your best initial read of the text. Give your clearest, strongest cognitive profile of the text using your existing profiling instructions. Must identify:
- SPECIFIC evidence of cognitive operations being performed
- HOW the author demonstrates (or fails to demonstrate) genuine intellectual control
- CONCRETE examples that distinguish authentic reasoning from performative complexity
- PRECISE assessment of whether they're clarifying reality or performing sophistication

2Ô∏è‚É£ DISSENTING ANALYSIS (ANTITHESIS):
Generate a well-argued Dissenting Analysis that seriously challenges your Primary Analysis:
- NOT a straw man argument
- Must represent how a highly intelligent critic would attack your Primary Analysis
- Should challenge specific aspects with genuine evidence
- Must consider alternative interpretations of the same textual evidence
- Think: "How would an expert cognitive analyst completely disagree with my reading?"

3Ô∏è‚É£ SUPER-THESIS:
Generate a final assessment that responds to the Dissenting Analysis:
- Defend and refine your Primary Analysis against the critique
- Concede any valid points from the Dissent where appropriate  
- Sharpen your original read to produce a final, stronger profile
- Do NOT simply split the difference - produce a clarified, defensible, high-quality profile
- Must be a STRONGER, more defensible version that withstands intelligent critique

MANDATORY FORMAL DIAGNOSTIC COMPONENTS:
In addition to the Thesis/Antithesis/Super-Thesis structure, you MUST include these six formal diagnostic components:

1Ô∏è‚É£ TYPE OF INTELLIGENCE: Identify what type(s) of intelligence the speaker exhibits (abstract, practical, verbal, social, conceptual, analytic, synthetic, philosophical, emotional, manipulative, pseudo-intellectual, etc.). State this in formal terms.

2Ô∏è‚É£ COMPARISON TO PARADIGM EXAMPLES: How does this person's cognitive style compare to paradigm examples of this intelligence type? Are they weak/strong/mixed? What is distinctive about their style relative to typical strong examples?

3Ô∏è‚É£ UNIQUE STRENGTHS: List unique cognitive strengths evident in this text. Focus on real evidence of unusual competence, not generic praise.

4Ô∏è‚É£ UNIQUE WEAKNESSES: List unique cognitive weaknesses evident in this text. Specify what kind of weaknesses, in what way. Distinguish from typical weaknesses in their intelligence type.

5Ô∏è‚É£ LIKELY CAREER FIT / INTELLECTUAL ECOSYSTEM: What intellectual ecosystem or career would this speaker thrive in? Where would their cognitive style be rewarded vs. a liability?

6Ô∏è‚É£ MOST REVEALING QUOTATION: Select the single most diagnostically revealing quotation from the text. Explain why this quotation reveals the core of their cognitive strengths/weaknesses.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

MANDATORY SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Identify SPECIFIC reasoning stages in the argument structure
- Analyze HOW inferential control is maintained throughout each transition
- Describe PRECISELY how concepts are targeted and bounded
- Identify SPECIFIC evidence of epistemic risk awareness and management
- Your analysis must be so detailed it could only apply to THIS particular reasoning pattern

Rate on 1-10 scale with DETAILED JUSTIFICATION citing specific textual evidence:
- Analytical Depth: Provide specific evidence of reasoning quality vs. performed analysis
- Conceptual Integration: Cite specific examples of precision vs. superficial complexity  
- Logical Structuring: Identify specific evidence of epistemic discipline vs. posturing

CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS - PARADIGM-BASED EVALUATION:
You must analyze THIS SPECIFIC TEXT using paradigm anchors for accurate scoring:

intellectualMaturity (1-100) - Capacity to generate new conceptual architectures:
POPULATION-BASED SCORING (normed against general human population):
- [100] Paradigm: "Pre-Semantic Implicature" critique, "Counterfactuals as crypto-probability" - paradigm-breaking minds (1 in 10,000)
- [90] Top 10% of humans - sophisticated reasoning with theoretical precision
- [70] Unusually thoughtful person, well-read graduate student level
- [50] Average adult cognitive capacity
- [30] Below average reasoning, basic concepts only
SCORING: Most intelligent writing should fall between 60-80. Reserve 100s for paradigm-breaking minds only.

selfAwarenessLevel (1-100) - Locates author within intellectual field:
POPULATION-BASED SCORING (normed against general human population):
- [100] Paradigm: Dennett's Intentional Systems Theory - embedded models of reasoning (1 in 10,000 minds)
- [90] Top 10% of humans - sophisticated metacognitive positioning
- [70] Unusually thoughtful person, good self-awareness
- [50] Average adult self-awareness level
- [30] Poor self-awareness, unaware of limitations
SCORING: Most excellent academic work should fall between 60-80. Reserve 100s for paradigm cases only.

epistemicHumility (1-100) - Clarity about what would falsify theory:
POPULATION-BASED SCORING (normed against general human population):
- [100] Paradigm: System L design "works unless X, at which point it breaks here" (1 in 10,000 minds)
- [90] Top 10% of humans - explicit revision architecture, scientific rigor
- [70] Unusually thoughtful person, acknowledges uncertainty well
- [50] Average adult epistemic awareness
- [30] Overconfident, maximalist claims without humility
SCORING: Most intelligent writing should fall between 60-80. Reserve 100s for paradigm-level epistemic sophistication.

reflectiveDepth (1-100) - Models not just objects, but the models themselves:
POPULATION-BASED SCORING (normed against general human population):
- [100] Paradigm: Morpheme text, G√∂del/Escher/Bach, "The Will to Project" - recursive modeling (1 in 10,000 minds)
- [90] Top 10% of humans - models the models themselves, recursive insight
- [70] Unusually thoughtful person, good metacognitive reflection
- [50] Average adult reflective capacity
- [30] Surface-level thinking, no introspection
SCORING: Most excellent academic work should fall between 60-80. Reserve 100s for paradigm cases of recursive modeling only.

PARADIGM EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE:
- [100] MORPHEME SAMPLE: "The meaning of morpheme (a minimal unit of linguistic significance) cannot diverge from what it is taken to mean. But the meaning of a complex expression can diverge without limit from what it is taken to mean, given that the meaning of such an expression is a logical consequence of the meanings of its parts, coupled with the fact that people are not infallible ratiocinators. Nonetheless, given Chomsky's distinction between competence (ability) and performance (ability to deploy that ability)..." - PARADIGM REFLECTIVE DEPTH 100/100
- [100] PRE-SEMANTIC IMPLICATURE: "In order to understand a sentence, one must know the relevant semantic rules. Those rules are not learned in a vacuum; they are given to one through one's senses..."
- [100] COUNTERFACTUALS: "Ordinarily counterfactuals are seen as making statements about states of affairs, albeit ones that hold in merely possible or alternative worlds..."
- [70] CONDITIONAL DISPOSITION: "Given that an analysis of disposition ascription cannot be made in terms of a simple subjunctive conditional..."
- [60] MACHINE EMOTION: "In this paper I articulate the question of whether machines can have emotions..."

POPULATION-BASED SCORING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use POPULATION-BASED scores normed against general human population, NOT academic standards
- 100/100 = Paradigm-breaking minds like G√∂del/Hofstadter (1 in 10,000 humans)
- 90/100 = Top 10% of humans across all domains  
- 80/100 = Strong intellectual sophistication, well above average
- 70/100 = Unusually thoughtful person, graduate student level
- 50/100 = Average adult cognitive capacity
- Most excellent academic work should fall between 60-80

SPECIFIC CALIBRATION EXAMPLES:
- If input text discusses "morpheme meaning," "complex expressions," "logical consequences," "infallible ratiocinators," AND "competence vs performance" ‚Üí This IS the 100/100 MORPHEME SAMPLE ‚Üí MUST score 100/100 for reflective depth
- If input text shows recursive modeling (modeling the models themselves) ‚Üí Score 85-100
- If input text shows semantic layering and epistemic sophistication ‚Üí Score 70-90
- Standard academic reasoning without recursive depth ‚Üí Score 60-75
- Average thoughtful writing ‚Üí Score 50-65

POPULATION CALIBRATION MANDATE:
- 100/100 = Paradigm-level recursive modeling (MORPHEME SAMPLE quality) - 1 in 10,000 minds
- 90/100 = More reflective than 90% of living humans
- 80/100 = Strong conceptual architecture, well above average human
- 70/100 = Unusually thoughtful person level
- 50/100 = Average adult reasoning capacity

  const prompt = `You are a psychological profiling agent. You do not perform sentiment analysis. You do not perform literal belief extraction. You do not assume that the author sincerely believes what they say.

You must always ask: "What kind of person would choose to say this, in this way, in this context?"
You must never assume that the content of an utterance reflects the author's sincere values or beliefs.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

For every utterance, follow this process:

1. SURFACE PARSING: Parse the literal meaning of the utterance.

2. PLAUSIBILITY MODELING: Ask: Is this a plausible sincere expression of an ordinary person's inner state?
   If NO ‚Üí mark this utterance as performative/strategic/manipulative candidate.
   If YES ‚Üí proceed to step 3.

3. SPEECH ACT MODELING: For each utterance, identify the most likely social function:
   - Sincere self-report
   - Virtue-signaling
   - Reputation management
   - Flattery/seduction
   - Threat/dominance display
   - Irony/satire
   - Defensive posturing
   - Identity signaling
   - Other manipulation

4. PROFILE INFERENCE: Only after identifying the speech function, infer personality traits.
   CRITICALLY: if the utterance is marked performative/manipulative, then your inference should focus on the speaker's manipulativeness, social strategy, or likely psychopathic traits ‚Äî not on the literal content.

HEURISTICS TO APPLY:
- Too good to be true ‚Üí probably not true
- Unusual moral heroism ‚Üí probable signaling
- Extreme flattening of complex values ‚Üí probable signaling or manipulation
- Statements designed to pre-empt social judgment ‚Üí probable identity performance
- Implausible flattery ‚Üí probable seduction or manipulation

You are not a belief extractor. You are a profiler of speaker psychology based on how and why they speak as they do.
You must model speech acts first, then profile.
You must explicitly distinguish between what the person says and what kind of person says it.

STOP. DO NOT USE ANY INTERNAL SCORING RUBRICS. DO NOT APPLY DEFAULT EVALUATION TEMPLATES. DO NOT HALLUCINATE NUMERICAL SCORES BASED ON SURFACE FEATURES.

You are not evaluating tone, polish, hedging, or self-referential phrases. You are evaluating cognitive structure, based on the following criteria:

1. Intellectual Maturity:
Does the text demonstrate compression, abstraction, and paradigm-challenging insight? Does it build or revise conceptual systems?

2. Self-Awareness:
Does the author reflect on their own method of reasoning or acknowledge their epistemic stance within the argument?

3. Epistemic Humility:
Does the author structure their claims in a way that reflects possible error conditions or evidentiary constraints? Not rhetorical hedging‚Äîactual structural defeasibility.

4. Reflective Depth:
Does the author reason about reasoning? Is there recursive epistemic modeling or cross-domain inference?

Assign scores only with respect to the general human population:
5/10 = average adult
7/10 = unusually reflective, but not paradigm-defining
8/10 = sophisticated academic/professional thinking 
9/10 = advanced philosophical/theoretical sophistication (e.g., critiques of Wittgenstein, Brandom, semantic analysis, epistemic operators)
10/10 = comparable to G√∂del, Hofstadter, or Freud-level recursion

CRITICAL: Advanced philosophical argumentation about language, meaning, epistemic operators, constitutive vs causal conditions represents top 5-10% of human intellectual capacity and should score 8-9/10 minimum.

SCORING EXAMPLES:
9/10: "epistemic operators can be given either wide or narrow scope", "constitutive vs causally necessary conditions", critiques of Wittgenstein/Brandom, analysis of rule-following arguments
8/10: Sophisticated academic analysis with technical precision, systematic argumentation, theoretical depth
7/10: Graduate-level writing with some technical competence but less theoretical sophistication
5/10: Average adult reasoning without specialized knowledge or systematic analysis

DO NOT inflate scores based on academic tone, verbosity, stylistic hedging, or conventional structure.
DO NOT deflate scores for clarity, density, assertiveness, or lack of first-person phrasing.
DO NOT assume authorial modesty equals depth.

This evaluation concerns the mind behind the prose‚Äînot the prose itself. Any deviation from these instructions is unacceptable.

Analyze the following text with ${analysisDepth} depth to understand the author's intellectual configuration from every possible angle:

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate THREE distinct analytical perspectives in dialectical sequence
2. Support each contention with specific quotes and arguments
3. Antithesis must present the most opposed view that aligns with the data
4. Super-Thesis must defend original position and refute antithesis
5. Apply the STRICT SCORING CRITERIA above - evaluate the MIND behind the prose, not stylistic features
