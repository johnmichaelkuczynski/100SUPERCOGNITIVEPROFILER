Test document with mathematical expressions to verify deployment fix:

1. Basic algebra: x² + y² = z²

2. Calculus: ∫₀^∞ e^(-x²) dx = √π/2

3. Economics inflation formula: π = (P_t - P_{t-1})/P_{t-1} × 100

4. Greek letters: α, β, γ, θ, λ, μ, σ, Σ, Π

5. Complex fraction: U = (x₁ + x₂)/(x₃ + x₄)

6. Summation: Σ(i=1 to n) x_i
