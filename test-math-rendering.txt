Logic and Set Theory Test Document

This document contains mathematical expressions to test the math rendering system.

Currency examples (should remain as regular text):
The cost is $25 for basic service and $1,000 for premium service.
Budget allocation: $5 million for research, $2.5k for supplies.

Mathematical expressions (should be converted to LaTeX):
Let $P \rightarrow Q$ represent logical implication.
The set $A \cap B$ denotes intersection.
Consider the function $f(x) = x^2 + \alpha x + \beta$.
The utility function $U^{\text{Veblen}}$ maximizes satisfaction.
Proof by induction: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

Mixed content:
The research costs $500 per participant, but the formula $\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$ determines the angle.
Budget: $25,000 total with mathematical model $E = mc^2$ for energy calculations.

Set theory notation:
Let $\mathcal{P}(A)$ denote the power set of A.
For any sets $X$ and $Y$, we have $X \cup Y = \{z : z \in X \text{ or } z \in Y\}$.

Logic symbols:
$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ (for all real numbers x)
$\exists y \in \mathbb{N}$ (there exists a natural number y)
$\neg P \vee Q$ (not P or Q)
